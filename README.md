# Trivia Game

Trivia Game is created with HTML, CSS and jQuery.

This application uses jQuery timers - setTimeout and setInterval.

Quiz questions are displayed with an interval using timer value set, so the user can try to answer the given question in the specified time. Once question time is over correct answer is displayed with a timeout set for the next question. so after the timeout next question appears for the user.

## How it Works

- Trivia Game shows only one question until the player answers it or their time runs out.

- If the player selects the correct answer, a screen displays his answer is correct and the correct answer. It is similar for wrong answers and time-outs.

- If the player runs out of time, a screen is displayed for 2 seconds before the next question that says time's up and the correct answer . 

- If the player chooses the wrong answer, a screen is displayed to tell the player they selected the wrong option and waits for 2 seconds before showing the next question. 

- on the final screen, number of correct, incorrect answers and unanswered are shown with an option to start the game again.
